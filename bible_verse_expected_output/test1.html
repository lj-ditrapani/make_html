<p class="verse-box"><span class="reference">Romans 3:20</span>
For no person will be justified (made righteous, acquitted, and judged
acceptable) in His sight by observing the works prescribed by the Law.
For [the real function of] the Law is to make men recognize and be
conscious of sin [not mere perception, but an acquaintance with sin 
which works toward repentance, <strong>faith</strong>, and holy character].
