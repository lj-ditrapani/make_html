Mark 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jesus, knowing what the pharisees evil hearts were thinking decided to
make evident the removal of guilt by removing it's consequences so He
told this man. "Pick up your mat and walk."

{"verse": "AMP Mark 2:5"}
And when Jesus saw their faith [their confidence in God through Him], He
said to the paralyzed man, Son, your sins are forgiven [you] and put
away [that is, the penalty is remitted, the sense of guilt removed, and
you are made upright and in right standing with God].

Dear reader. Do not let anyone rob you of the freedom of knowing your
sins and guilt has been completely removed.
